# testing-async-js-practice

This is an assessment provided by Thinkful. The goal was to write tests for a number of functions that make external requests using the axios library. Each function makes an HTTP request.

For the create() function, I wrote a test to verify that the function does the following:

Makes a POST request to the appropriate URL
Resolves with a promise containing the newly saved student
Log an error to the console

For the show() function, I wrote the test to verify the following:

Makes a GET request to the appropriate URL
Resolves with a promise containing the student data
Logs an error to the console
